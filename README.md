In this project, a system that activates home security systems was made. We designed this system in a way that can be applied on FPGA boards. The software application used is Vivado. Here, VHDL code, .xdc code and test bench code are available.
The working principle of the system: 9 ports will be used in the system, 5 of these ports are input and 4 are output. The input ports are entrance room, living room, garage, bypass and override. The output is the alarm systems, sensor LEDs. If there is any movement in the living room, entrance room and garage, the sensor LEDs here will light up. If there is movement in any two rooms, the alarm will work. If the override switch is open, the sensor LEDs will light up but the alarm will not light up. If the bypass switch is open, the sensor LEDs and the alarm LED will not light up. Good luck in advance.
